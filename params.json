These tests are written in Java, using Java\r\n8's new lambda syntax and run in [JUnit](http://junit.org).\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\n- Make a test class\r\n- Tag it with `@RunWith(JavaSpecRunner.class)`.\r\n- Do any test setup you want to do in a public, no-arg constructor (similar to JUnit).\r\n- Include 1 or more `It` fields in the class and assign a thunk (a no-arg, anonymous function) like so:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nIt does_something_cool = () -> assertEquals(\"hello\", widget.sayHello());\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Run this test anywhere you run JUnit.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
